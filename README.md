# trendInflation

code for trend inflation model of Mertens (2016, REStat, http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00549) and Garnier, Mertens and Nelson (2015, IJCB, http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb15q4a2.htm).

The model implemented here is the variant with SV in all inflation gaps.

The `master` branch takes US data, provided by FRED, as inputs (currently measures of realized inflation, inlcuding trimmed mean and median measures).

The branch `euroarea` uses Euro area data, including Euroarea SPF expectations, as provided by the ECB as inputs.

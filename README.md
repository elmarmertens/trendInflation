# Code to estimate Trend Inflation

code for trend inflation model of Mertens (2016, REStat, http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00549) and Garnier, Mertens and Nelson (2015, IJCB, http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb15q4a2.htm).

The model implemented here is the variant with SV in all inflation gaps.

The `master` branch works with US as well as EuroAre data. US data provided by FRED (for realized and trimmed inflation; use of surveys is pending). Euro area data as obtained from the ECB's SDW, including Euroarea SPF expectations.
